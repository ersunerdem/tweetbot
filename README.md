# TweetBot

## Project Description:

A keras model and tweet scraper that gathers tweets from various accounts (in this project as is: meme accounts) and compiles an LSTM model trained on that twitter content data to generate its own tweets.

## How to Install and Run:

Pull this repository and first run get-twitter-data.py. Then, run tweetbot.py.

## Future Plans:

* Improve model architecture
* Add controls for which accounts get data scraped (rather than hard-coded)
* Add UI and single program to run the other two
